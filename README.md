# Shut-the-Box
## Currently Semi-complete / semi - working
problems:
    output: 1 X 3 4 X X X X X
    diceVal is 2
    problem cannot put 2 in again because it was already used once
    see why loop does not terminate due to their being nothing in the vector that can add up to 2 except 2
    maybe just add a condition for 2 and 1 if i add the 7 8 9 condition
